# Gas Mileage

I've been tracking my fillups since August 2011:
* date;
* odometer reading (miles);
* amount of gas (gallons); and 
* cost of gas (US Dollars)

In this file, I played with the numbers to see what's changed about my driving habits over the last 6 years, and made the following plots. Vertical red lines in any plot represent the date my marriage stopped being long-distance, and I stopped doing so much driving.

1. Gas price over time.
2. Gas price over time with overlaid LOESS smoothing.
3. Number of days between stops at the gas station. 
4. Number of days between stops at the gas station, with overlaid LOESS smoothing.
5. Boxplot of number of days between stops at the gas station, grouped by quarter.
6. Boxplot of number of days between stops at the gas station, grouped by 6-months intervals.
7. Odometer reading over time. You can pick out a road trip in December of 2012.
8. Mileage (mpg) over time, with LOESS smoothing.
9. Boxplot of mpg over time, quarterly.
10. Boxplot of mpg over time, by 6-month intervals.
