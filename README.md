# Gas Mileage

I've been tracking my fillups since August 2011:
* date;
* odometer reading;
* amount of gas; and 
* cost of gas

Here I plan to look at the numbers!

1. odometer reading over time. 
2. then mileage time series: need to create new variable.
3. cost of gas over time
4. number of fillups per month
5. mileage per month (box plot/dots +/- std dev)
6. cost of gas per month
